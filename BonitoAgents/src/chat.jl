# ── The chat consumer loop ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ONE task per ChatModel drains `user_messages` and drives one prompt turn at a
# time. ALL chat-state mutation (`send!`/`append!`/`close`) happens on THIS
# task, so there is no funnel lock and the "user-submit lands mid agent-chunk"
# race cannot occur. Started in `start_chat_client!`; ends when `user_messages`
# is closed (chat teardown).
# Each turn runs in its OWN task — the consumer does NOT wait for one turn
# to resolve before sending the next prompt. Two reasons (both validated
# against the real agent on the raw wire):
#
#   1. STEERING. claude-agent-acp officially supports a `session/prompt`
#      while one is running (`promptQueueing: true` in its initialize
#      capabilities): the new user message is injected into the live turn,
#      and when the SDK replays it, the FIRST prompt resolves end_turn and
#      the stream hands off to the second. Serializing client-side would
#      forfeit that and turn every mid-turn message into a dead wait.
#   2. BACKGROUND SHELLS. While a background shell lives, the SDK never goes
#      idle, so the prompt that launched it NEVER resolves on its own —
#      the held-open turn is how the SDK delivers the shell's completion
#      notification later. The next prompt (handoff) is the only thing that
#      releases it. With a serializing consumer the user is locked out of
#      the chat for as long as the shell runs — the bug this fixes.
#
# Update ordering stays strict: the ACP dispatcher routes every
# session/update to the OLDEST unresolved prompt (the handoff contract), so
# concurrent run_turn! tasks never interleave message content.
