Register a project rooted at an existing folder ON THE WORKER. By default
NO bytes are pulled to the server — the project is immediately usable for
chat (which only needs `worker_path`), and the operator can later trigger an
async sync via `sync_project_to_server!` (e.g. the "Sync to server" button on
the project card or in the chat header menu). Pass `sync=true` to force a
synchronous pull at create time.

If `resume_session_id` is set to a claude-agent-acp session ID (the .jsonl
basename in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/`), the chat will use ACP's
`session/load` to resume that conversation — its history replays into the
chat UI and the agent regains full context. The ID persists across server
restarts.

Bring up `p`'s chat session on `worker_id`, transparently re-syncing
through the server. The server is the source of truth; workers are
caches that may drift between sessions (the user might edit files in
their own editor on the worker's filesystem outside BonitoAgents).

If `worker_id == p.worker_id` this is just `ensure_project_session!`.

Otherwise: `transfer_project!` does the atomic file-move (pre-pull
from source → push to target → re-bind), then a fresh session boots
on the target.

Failure semantics: if any step before `transfer_project!`'s re-bind
fails, `worker_id` is NOT flipped — the project remains bound to the
source. The error propagates to the caller (the dashboard's open-on
handler renders it in the error banner).

# ── Cross-worker sync modal ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Surfaced from the chat header when a project has a same-named sibling on
# another worker (see `same_name_siblings`). `sync_modal_state` is `nothing`
# (hidden) or `(current, other, comparison)` where comparison comes from
# `compare_projects`. The user picks a direction; `on_apply(src, dst)` runs the
# directional overwrite via `sync_across_workers!`. Reuses the `bt-collision-*`
# CSS that already ships in DashboardStyles.
# One opened-modal instance. Rendered via `jsrender` so its three button
# handlers register on the PER-RENDER sub-session (T22), not the long-lived
# parent — `map(session, sync_modal_state)` frees that sub-session when the
# modal closes / reopens, so handlers + the retained `comparison` don't pile up.
