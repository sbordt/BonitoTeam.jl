    project_sidebar(session, state, current_view) → DOM

Always-visible vertical nav. Top entry is "Home" (dashboard view); below
it, one entry per registered project.

The body re-renders ONLY when `state.projects` changes (project add /
remove / rename). Worker churn doesn't touch this section, so connecting
a new laptop or a worker going offline does not trigger any sidebar
work. Navigation (`current_view` change) does NOT
trigger a re-render: the click handler is delegated on the outer
`<aside>` via `onload`, and active-highlighting is handled by an `onjs`
class swap on the existing DOM. This matters because every re-render
tears down the body subsession, and any Observable interpolated into
that subsession's DOM gets caught in a tracked-object refcount race
with the new subsession (Bonito Sessions.js GLOBAL_OBJECT_CACHE). By
keeping `current_view` only on the OUTER aside (parent session, never
torn down), it crosses the JS bridge once at initial render and stays
in cache forever.

# this existed the overlay vanished the instant the model landed server-side
# — but the pane's DOM still had to ship, mount, and settle, so the user saw
# bring-up card → ~1s of bare background → a separate per-chat curtain.
# Now ONE card (identical classes/geometry to `project_loading_view`'s) stays
# up from click to settle and only its sub-text changes:
#
#   "Connecting to <worker>…"   project_loading_view, while session/load runs
#   "Loading the chat…"         this card, pane DOM shipping + mounting
#   "Rendering messages…"       chat module mounted, settle watch running
#
# The chat module drives the hand-offs: `_startSettle` (bonitoagents.js)
# dispatches `bt-chat-settling` / `bt-chat-settled` window events carrying
# the pane pid, and mirrors them as `data-bt-settling` / `data-bt-settled`
# flags on the `.bt-chatpane` so a card that mounts AFTER an event fired
# (kept-alive revisit, rapid navigation) can read the current state
# synchronously instead of waiting for the next event.
#
# A struct + jsrender (not a plain function) for the same reason as
# ChatPaneRef below: `Bonito.onload` must register against the SUBSESSION
# that renders this card (the overlay re-renders one per `current_view`
# change) — registered on the parent session, whose document loaded long
# ago, the mount hook would never fire.
