# Single-shared-server runner for the e2e suites.
#
# Each `test/e2e/<suite>.jl` exposes `run_suite(server)`: it swaps the shared server's
# agent script to its own and drives the ONE open browser page, scoped to its own
# chat. It does NOT create or close a server. This runner creates the dev_server +
# opens the browser ONCE, includes each suite into its OWN Module (so their
# top-level `agent_script` / helper names don't collide), injects the SHARED
# `TestKit` into each module first (so every suite drives the one server through
# the one harness type — re-including TestKit would make incompatible TestServer
# types), and calls `Mod.run_suite(server)` in sequence. State accumulates across suites
# by design (a soak); at the END we run a leak audit, then close once.
#
# Ordering rule: suites that DESTROY shared server state run LAST.
#   * worker_lifecycle.jl kills the MAIN worker -> dead last (no chat can bind
#     after it).
#   * cross_worker.jl kills a SECOND worker only -> safe mid-run.
#
# Run:  DISPLAY=:1 julia --project=. test/e2e/run_all.jl

# streaming_flood runs EARLY (2nd), on a near-empty session, on purpose: it tests
# the server-side `deliver_update!` deadlock regression (a 500-burst must not wedge
# the turn), which is independent of how many chats are open. Run late it instead
# trips a SEPARATE, known client-side bug — streaming a large burst gets
# pathologically slow once many messages are already mounted in the browser
# (measured: 500-burst renders in ~1s as chat #1–2, but the renderer WEDGES by
# chat #3; cost ≈ mounted × streamed — stale cross-chat subscribers). That bug is
# tracked on its own; it must not sabotage the deadlock regression's browser check.
