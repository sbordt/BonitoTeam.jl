# End-to-end test for the transparent cross-worker move.
#
# Brings up a real BonitoAgents server, spawns two mock workers (A, B) that
# both speak the worker control protocol AND handle `open_transfer` via
# RemoteSync. Walks a project from A → B → A and asserts:
#
# 1. Files written out-of-band on A get pulled to B (pre-pull captures
#    edits the user made in their editor without clicking "Sync to server").
# 2. Files deleted on A also disappear on B (mirror semantics — adds AND
#    deletions propagate).
# 3. `p.worker_id` / `p.worker_path` flip atomically to B; the chat
#    storage lives in `state.state_dir/chats/<project_id>/` so it follows
#    the project across moves without sync.
# 4. Moving back to A propagates B's subsequent edits in both directions.
# 5. Source-offline fallback: if A goes offline mid-test, moving to B
#    still works using the server's last-known mirror.
#
# No claude / no Electron — this is a backend integration test.
