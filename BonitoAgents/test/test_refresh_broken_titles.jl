# Regression test for the Rescan "repair broken titles" sweep.
#
# Backstory: project titles are backfilled exactly once from the first user
# message (gated by `p.title === nothing`). When the wrapper-stripping
# regex in `meaningful_title` had bugs (no support for `<tag attr="x">` or
# `<tag/>`), the broken title got saved and pinned forever — Rescan didn't
# touch it. The Rescan button now sweeps projects on the just-scanned
# worker, finds the leaked titles, and re-derives them from chat.md.

# with a leaked title pointing at that chat_dir, then exercise the sweep.
