# Sidebar's unified "Open chats" list + per-entry LED status.
#
# `open_chat_projects` decides which projects appear. A project is "open"
# iff the user has interacted with it (title backfilled OR resume_session_id
# imported from claude-agent-acp). Both markers persist in projects.json,
# so the list survives server AND worker restarts — no more sidebar going
# empty when you bounce the server.
#
# `chat_status` computes the LED state used by the sidebar:
#   :offline — worker isn't online OR isn't registered
#   :online  — worker up, no agent turn in flight (resumable OR idle live chat)
#   :active  — busy_active==true on a live ChatModel (claude is thinking)

# anchors an `on(busy_active) do _; notify_chats!(state); end` so a prompt
# going in-flight (or finishing) fans through the chain WITHOUT polling.
# We can't easily probe the live DOM from a unit test, but we CAN observe
# that `chat_signal` fires on `busy_active` flips — that's the only edge
# the sidebar's `onjs` needs to recompute. End-to-end DOM verification
# belongs in a real-browser e2e suite.
