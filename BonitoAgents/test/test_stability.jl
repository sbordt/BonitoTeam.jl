# Regression tests for the 2026-06-10 stability review (BonitoAgents findings
# T1–T22). Each @testset pins the Julia-side invariant a fix established so the
# bug can't silently come back. UI-only races (where the only observable is in
# the browser) are asserted at the server-side seam the fix touches.
#
# These are headless: no real worker subprocess, no browser. Where a finding is
# about a worker RPC we drive the `pending_rpcs` table directly; where it's about
# the chat consumer/poller we use a `MockTransport`.
