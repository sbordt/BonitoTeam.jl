# cooperative stop — it checks no flag — so the only lever to actually STOP it is
# `Malt.interrupt` (SIGINT). It's unreliable and can crash the worker, so we don't
# use it for OUR OWN loops (those stop via messages); but for stopping user code
# it's the only tool, used deliberately here. A worker-kill fallback
# (`finalize_cancelled_eval!`) covers code that swallows InterruptException so a
# cancelled eval can never orphan-run forever.
#
# We don't take a session's `lock` (the in-flight poll may hold it); `Malt.interrupt`
