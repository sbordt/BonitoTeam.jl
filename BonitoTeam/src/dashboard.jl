Register a project rooted at an existing folder ON THE WORKER. By default
NO bytes are pulled to the server — the project is immediately usable for
chat (which only needs `worker_path`), and the operator can later trigger an
async sync via `sync_project_to_server!` (e.g. the "Sync to server" button on
the project card or in the chat header menu). Pass `sync=true` to force a
synchronous pull at create time.

If `resume_session_id` is set to a claude-agent-acp session ID (the .jsonl
basename in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/`), the chat will use ACP's
`session/load` to resume that conversation — its history replays into the
chat UI and the agent regains full context. The ID persists across server
restarts.

If `worker_id == p.worker_id` this is just `ensure_project_session!`.

Otherwise: `transfer_project!` does the atomic file-move (pre-pull
from source → push to target → re-bind), then a fresh session boots
on the target.

Failure semantics: if any step before `transfer_project!`'s re-bind
fails, `worker_id` is NOT flipped — the project remains bound to the
source. The error propagates to the caller (the dashboard's open-on
handler renders it in the error banner).
