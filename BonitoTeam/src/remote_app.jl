# mirror (the browser fetches assets over HTTP). There is NO Malt on the frame
# path — every Bonito frame is just bytes on the websocket, both directions. Malt

# include RemoteProxy, build the bridge, start the dial. See BonitoMCP/RemoteProxy.jl.

# Wire format on the dial-back WS: `[tag][payload]`.
#   * `D` (data)    — a Bonito frame, piped verbatim (worker→browser and back).

#                     `asset_read` (lazy range fetch), `close` (a subsession),
#                     and the worker→host `asset_add`/`asset_remove` push.

Bridge host-side wiring (the worker→browser frame relay in `handle_eval_ws`, the
browser→worker routing, and the per-worker asset registry) is attached ONCE to
the tab's stable root session — see `attach_bridge_host!`. This call sends a
`delegate` control frame; the worker renders a FRESH subsession of the bridge
parent, packs its init bundle as a `BinaryAsset` (pushing `asset_add` control
frames the relay registers on `eb.asset_host`), and replies `(sub_id, html,
init_url)`. We wait until the init bundle is serveable before returning so the
browser's `fetch(init_url)` can't race ahead to a 404.

Because a `Collapsable` tool body is re-rendered on every expand (and the old
DOM is dropped with `innerHTML=''`, which does NOT close the proxied sub), we
explicitly close the previously-mounted worker sub for this (tab, app) — that
releases its asset and frees its browser-side listeners (see `close_remote_sub!`).

# A `bonito_app` ToolMsg in the chat renders its body lazily via
# `render_tool_body` → a `RemoteAppPlaceholder`, whose `jsrender` runs
# `embed_remote_app` against the live per-tab `Bonito.Session` (mounted by the
# existing `ToolRenderCommand` → `dom_in_js` path). Each placeholder carries
# the project's `EvalBridge` + the app id under which the worker registered the
# app on its `RemoteProxy` bridge (the ToolMsg only carries that id, like
# `bt_show` carries a path).

# repeated tool-body renders (auto-expand can fire more than once, and `dom_in_js`
# makes a new subsession each time) never collide on a shared id — the obsolete
# mounts self-clean when their DOM is removed (browser → `CloseSession` → worker).
# The bridge's expensive host wiring (frame relay, routing, asset registry) is

    show_remote_app!(model::ChatModel, eb::EvalBridge, code::AbstractString; title=...) -> id

Add a live interactive worker app to `model`'s chat as an auto-expanded tool
bubble. `code` is Julia source that evaluates to a `Bonito.App`; it's shipped to
the worker over a `register` control frame, `include_string`-d there, and
registered via `RemoteProxy.register_app!`. Each browser tab embeds its own
subsession of the bridge parent on expand. (The primary path is the `bt_show_app`
MCP tool, which registers over BonitoMCP's own Malt link; this is the
BonitoTeam-side convenience over the raw bridge.)
