# Server-side handlers for inbound worker connections. Workers dial the
# server; the server tracks each worker's "control" WS and pairs per-session
# ACP WSs with the right project.
#
# Endpoints (registered as Bonito websocket_route!s):
#   /worker-ws    → control channel. Worker sends a hello frame; we register
#                   it in state.workers, mark online, and keep the WS for
#                   sending commands like "open_session" / "open_transfer".
#   /worker-acp   → per-session WS. Worker dials this in response to an
#                   "open_session" command and identifies the WS by sid; we
#                   pair it with a Channel that `start_session(::WorkerTransport)` is
#                   blocked on.
#   /transfer-ws  → directional librsync transfer; worker dials this in
#                   response to an "open_transfer" command; pairs the WS
#                   with whichever sync_dir_*_worker! call is waiting.

Stream a single file from the named worker into `dst_path` on the server.
Reuses the `/transfer-ws` handoff already used by directory sync, but with

Used by the chat UI's bt_show preview renderer when the file isn't in

result before the file gets RemoteSync'd as part of a project sync).

Inverse of `fetch_file_from_worker`: push a single file from the
server-side `src_path` to the worker-side `dst_path`. No directory
walking — used when only one file changed (image paste, single tool
output, Julia eval artifact) and a full project sync would be
overkill on a large project tree.

Worker writes the bytes via `RemoteSync.receive_file`, which writes
straight to disk in bounded chunks (memory-safe regardless of size)
and creates any missing parent directories.
