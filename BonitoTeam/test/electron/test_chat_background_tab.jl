# Regression test: new messages must appear in the DOM even when
# `requestAnimationFrame` is paused (backgrounded browser tab / window).
#
# Background: Chrome + Firefox pause rAF in backgrounded tabs (no callbacks
# fire). Earlier `appendNewMessage` queued its auto-scroll via
# `_queueScrollToBottom` → rAF. While the tab was backgrounded, new messages
# went into `__bt_chat.cache` but never into the DOM, because:
#
#   1. `updateDOM` had been called with the *pre-scroll* visibleRange,
#      which didn't include the new (bottom-of-content) bubble's index.
#   2. The rAF that was supposed to scroll to bottom + re-update never fired.
#
# When the user finally re-focused the tab, the queued rAF fired and all
# the cached-but-invisible bubbles appeared "instantly" — manifesting in
# the wild as "I sent a message and 5 old replies appeared at once".
#
# The fix replaces rAF batching in `appendNewMessage` with a synchronous
# `scrollToBottom()` (which itself calls `refresh()` → `updateDOM` with
# the post-scroll visible range). Synchronous DOM/scroll writes work
# regardless of tab visibility.
#
# This test reproduces the stuck-rAF condition by manually setting
# `_scrollQueued = true` and `_scrollRafId = -1` (a state a real
# backgrounded tab gets stuck in), then exercises `appendNewMessage`
# and asserts the new bubble lands in the DOM.
