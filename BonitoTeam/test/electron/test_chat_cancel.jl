# End-to-end stop / cancel tests against a real `serve()` + Electron.
#
# The stop feature is critical UX — when the agent is streaming a long
# response (or stuck in a tool call) the user MUST be able to interrupt.
# Two trigger paths to cover:
#
#   1. Click on the `.bt-stop-btn` DOM button.
#   2. Press ESC anywhere in the chat (textarea focused or not).
#
# Both ship `{type: 'cancel'}` over the comm Observable, which the Julia
# side picks up in `handle_command!(::CancelCommand)` and turns into an
# ACP `session/cancel` notification (off-lock, directly — NOT through
# `apply!`, so even a long-held `model.lock` mid-finalize can't block
# the cancel from going out).
#
# A real claude-agent-acp run would be too slow + non-deterministic, so
# we drive these against a custom `MockTransport` that:
#
#   - Streams `chunks_per_turn` agent_message_chunk events with a small
#     per-chunk delay (gives the test time to interject mid-stream).
#   - Honors `session/cancel` notifications: sets a flag, the streamer
#     bails on its next iteration, and immediately fires the
#     `session/prompt` response with `stopReason: "cancelled"`.
#
# That mirrors what a well-behaved claude does, AND lets the test verify
# the cancel actually reached the mock (we can inspect the flag).
