# End-to-end of the background-task STOP path through a REAL worker subprocess:
#   request_tool_stop! → kill_worker_file_writers (WS command to the worker) →
#   worker handle_kill_file_writers (SIGTERM the fd holders + tree) → the held
#   process actually dies. Plus the pill-finalize side (finalize_bg_task!).
#
# This covers the code I shipped that the unit tests do NOT: the WS RPC
# round-trip (client send_command ↔ worker dispatch) and the full stop wiring.
# Pure Julia + a spawned worker subprocess (no Electron / agent).
