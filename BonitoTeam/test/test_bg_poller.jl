# Lifecycle invariants for the per-chat background-output poller.
#
# What the user asked for and these tests pin down:
#
#   • One task PER ChatModel — not a global server-wide loop walking
#     `state.chat_models`. The task IS the server's mirror of the JS
#     taskbar: same source-of-truth set on both sides
#     (`is_background && bg_running && !empty(bg_output_path)`), same
#     1 s cadence.
#   • Spawned in `start_chat_client!`, so a chat that never had a live
#     bg item still has a poller — idempotent (re-call on restart finds
#     the existing live task and no-ops), cheap (sleeps and walks an
#     empty store).
#   • Lifetime tied to the chat: when the task throws / errormonitors,
#     the registry entry self-cleans via the `finally` in
#     `start_background_poller!`.
#   • No `BG_POLL_INTERVAL` global constant — the 1 s sleep is inline
#     in `background_poll_loop`. The cadence is a property of the
#     poller task, not server config.
