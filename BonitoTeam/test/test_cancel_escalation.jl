# Headless test: force-close is the LAST resort for a genuinely wedged agent
# (resumed onto an orphaned tool call — ignores `session/cancel`, connection
# stays alive so no `ConnectionClosed` ever fires). It must be:
#   • never automatic on a timer — that races legitimate cold/resumed cancels
#     (honor latency 6–18s+) and a premature mid-turn teardown leaves an orphaned
#     tool_use that wedges every future resume (a doom loop);
#   • never triggered by an impatient double-click — that's the same trap;
#   • triggered ONLY by a deliberate re-cancel after the agent has had a real
#     chance (≥ CANCEL_ESCALATE_WAIT) and the turn is still busy.
