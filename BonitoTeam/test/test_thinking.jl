# Tests for the agent-thinking path, end to end:
#
#   ACP coalescer   — agent_thought_chunk(s) → one `Thought`, text reconstructed
#   process!        — transient "reasoning…" indicator; commit a ThoughtMsg ONLY
#                     if non-empty (this agent redacts thinking → empty thoughts,
#                     which must leave no trace in the store)
#   persistence     — a non-empty thought round-trips append_thought → load_history
#                     (reloaded with id + text); empty thoughts are not persisted
#   wire shapes     — wire_new / wire_final carry the thought id + html
#   Collapsable     — the eager server-side component renders a <details>
#
# Background: claude-agent-acp returns thinking blocks with an empty plaintext
# `thinking` field and only an encrypted `signature`, so every thought reaching
# us is empty. The pipeline must (a) still signal "the model is reasoning" and
# (b) never render/persist an empty bubble — while staying correct for a future
# agent that DOES expose plaintext thinking.
