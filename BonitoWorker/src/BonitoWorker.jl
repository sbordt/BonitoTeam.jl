module BonitoWorker

# Outbound-only worker: dials the BonitoAgents server, holds a "control" WS open,
# spawns claude-agent-acp + a dedicated per-session WS each time the server
# requests a new session.
#
# Worker has NO inbound listener — no firewall hole on the worker side.
# Single port to open is on the server (8038), already needed for browsers.

# `HOME` / `%APPDATA%` ourselves. Holds the stable `worker_id`, the install
# `config.json`, and the detached worker's `worker.log`.
#

# ── Claude session scanner ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Discovers Claude Code projects from the on-disk session history under
# `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/`. We don't try to enumerate live claude
# processes (Linux /proc only; macOS/Windows need OS-specific libproc / PEB
# work); the history walk surfaces both completed and currently-running
# sessions, since active sessions write to a jsonl in the same directory.
#
# The encoded folder name is NOT used to recover the project path — Claude
# Code maps `/`, `.`, AND `_` all to `-`, so the inverse is ambiguous and
# silently fails for any project name containing `.` or `_` (i.e. every
# Julia `Foo.jl` package, every snake_case directory). Instead we read the
# `cwd` field from inside each jsonl. We re-read per jsonl (not once per
# encoded folder) so that subagent rows reflect the cwd recorded in THAT
# subagent's file — if it ran in a nested directory, we honor it.

const CWD_LINE_LIMIT    = 100  # cwd typically lands on line 1-3, but generous
const PREVIEW_MAX_CHARS = 120  # truncated length for the dashboard preview line

"""
    scan_claude_sessions(; home) → Vector{Dict{String,Any}}

Enumerate Claude Code sessions under `~/.claude/projects/`. One entry per
discovered `.jsonl` (top-level session jsonl AND each subagent jsonl), sorted
by `last_used` descending. Each entry has:

- `path`              — absolute project directory (read from a `cwd` field
                        in the jsonl content, not derived from the folder name)
- `name`              — `basename(path)`
- `session_id`        — basename of the jsonl minus `.jsonl`. For top-level
                        sessions this is the UUID Claude Code uses for
                        `session/load`; for subagents it is the agent id
                        (e.g. `agent-a56e94ef589608347`).
- `last_used`         — Unix timestamp (jsonl mtime)
- `kind`              — `"session"` or `"subagent"`
- `agent_type`        — `nothing` for sessions; for subagents, the `agentType`
                        from the sibling `<id>.meta.json` (e.g. `"Explore"`).
- `parent_session_id` — `nothing` for sessions; for subagents, the UUID
                        directory name immediately above `subagents/`.
- `running`           — `true`  iff `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` exists for
                        this `session_id` AND the OS confirms that PID is
                        still alive; `false` if no sessions file exists or the
                        OS says the PID is gone; `nothing` if the OS-level
                        liveness check is unavailable (e.g. Windows path
                        couldn't open the process handle for unknown reasons).
                        Subagents share their parent's process, so they're
                        never tracked in `~/.claude/sessions/` and always get
                        `running = false`.
- `pid`               — set only when `running === true`; the OS PID of the
                        live Claude CLI process. `nothing` otherwise.
- `first_prompt`      — short preview of the first user-message text in the
                        jsonl (whitespace-collapsed, truncated to
                        PREVIEW_MAX_CHARS). `nothing` if the jsonl contains no
                        real user message in its first `CWD_LINE_LIMIT` lines.

Folders whose jsonls yield no `cwd` field (malformed / empty) are skipped.
