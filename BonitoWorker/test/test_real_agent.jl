# Real-agent integration test for BonitoWorker.
#
# Why this exists: every Windows regression we've hit (.cmd shim resolution,
# Node version mismatch, EACCES on worker.log, path-in-cwd corruption,
# "ACP connection closed") lives in the path between "server says
# open_session" and "claude-agent-acp emits its first ACP frame." The
# existing electron suite mocks the entire ACP transport, so none of those
# bugs are observable there. This test exercises the real path:
#
#   1. Stand up a minimal HTTP+WS server in this process, just /worker-ws +
#      /worker-acp routes — no Bonito, no BonitoAgents dep.
#   2. Spawn BonitoWorker as a real subprocess via worker_standalone.jl.
#   3. Wait for the worker's hello on /worker-ws, ack it.
#   4. Send `open_session` over the control WS.
#   5. The worker spawns the real `claude-agent-acp` and dials /worker-acp.
#   6. Send an ACP `initialize` request through the relay; assert we
#      receive a well-formed result. That's the proof of life — it means
#      the .cmd resolved, Node parsed the agent JS, the agent process is
#      alive, and the bidirectional WS↔stdio relay works.
#
# We deliberately don't send a `session/prompt` — that would burn Claude
# API quota for no extra coverage of the bug classes we're targeting.
#
# Skipped automatically when `claude-agent-acp` isn't on PATH (CI without
# Claude Code installed).
