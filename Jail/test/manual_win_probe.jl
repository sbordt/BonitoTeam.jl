# Manual Windows probe — run from an INTERACTIVE terminal:
#
#     julia --project=Jail Jail/test/manual_win_probe.jl
#
# (or, from the repo root with the Jail env active, `include` this file.)
#
# Why manual: Sandboxie attaches boxed *console* processes to the launcher's
# console session. When launched from a non-interactive/headless parent (e.g.
# an automation harness) there is no console session, so Sandboxie fails with
# SBIE2205 / STATUS_NOT_SAME_DEVICE (C00000D4) and the boxed console child never
# runs. From a real terminal that attach should succeed. This script exercises
# the real `jail()` and reports whether the whitelist is enforced.
