# bridged with a background task, anything).

# No directory is excluded any more. `.bonitoTeam/` used to live inside
# each project tree (chat.md + tools/) and had to be skipped because
# workers don't write one — mirror-sync would otherwise wipe the server's
# chat history when pulling. The chat storage now lives under

# A `rel` path arrives over the wire from the PEER's manifest/plan and is then
# fed to `joinpath(root, rel)` on BOTH sides (receiver writes, sender reads). A
# hostile or buggy peer can send an absolute path (`joinpath(root, "/etc/x")`
# == "/etc/x") or a `..`-escaping relative path and walk straight out of the
# sync root — arbitrary file write on the receiver, arbitrary file read /
# exfiltration on the sender. Every wire-supplied `rel` MUST pass through here
# before it touches the filesystem.
#
# `safe_rel(root, rel)` returns the normalized rel string when it stays inside
# `root`, or `nothing` when it would escape (absolute, `..`-escaping, or empty).
# Callers reject the entry on `nothing`. Comparison is done on normalized
# absolute paths so `a/../b`, trailing slashes, and `.` segments all collapse
# the same way (this also canonicalizes for the delete/membership pass, R7).
