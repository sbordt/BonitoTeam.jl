# IO-like adapter that turns a frame-oriented transport (e.g. an
# HTTP.WebSocket) into a byte stream the librsync drive loop and our wire
# protocol can use directly. We present a byte-stream view by buffering the
# latest received frame and serving `read`/`readbytes!` requests out of it.
#
# `WebSocketIO{WS}` stays parametric so callers can plug in any frame-oriented
# transport that implements `send_frame!` / `recv_frame` / `is_closed`. We
# also ship adapters for HTTP.WebSockets.WebSocket inline below; those used to
# live in a package extension, but the extension boundary added complexity
# (load-order races, methods missing in some sessions) without buying us
# anything — every consumer of RemoteSync also pulls in HTTP, so just depend
# on it directly.
